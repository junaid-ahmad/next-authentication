# Authentication in Next.js 14

Explore the future of web development with my personal project built on the cutting-edge features of Next.js! Leveraging the power of server-components and server-actions, my portfolio takes advantage of the latest advancements in Next.js to create a dynamic and seamless user experience.

## Getting Started:(#getting-started)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## KEY FEATURES:(#key-features)

- **App Router**: Experience smooth and client-side navigations with the [app-router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), providing a delightful and responsive user journey.

- **Server Components**: Embrace the modular, [server-rendered components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) for enhanced performance and maintainability.

- **Server Actions and Mutations**: [Server Actions]() are asynchronous functions that are executed on the server. They can be used in Server and Client Components to handle form submissions and data mutations in Next.js applications.

- **Next-auth for Authentication**: Secure your application with ease using [Next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/), a versatile authentication library seamlessly integrated into the project.

This project serves as both a showcase of my skills and a playground for exploring the latest Next.js features. Dive into the code, explore the components, and witness the future of web development unfold.
